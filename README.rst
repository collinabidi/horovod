Horovod is a distributed deep learning training framework for TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, and Apache MXNet.
The goal of Horovod is to make distributed deep learning fast and easy to use.

This version of Horovod has SHMEM enabled and was built by Collin Abidi at NSF SHREC, University of Pittsburgh.

Dependencies
-------
These are versions of packages/libraries that are necessary/known to work when using Shmorovod. Python packages are installed using ``pip``.

Horovod is hosted by the `LF AI & Data Foundation <https://lfdl.io>`_ (LF AI & Data). If you are a company that is deeply
committed to using open source technologies in artificial intelligence, machine, and deep learning, and want to support
the communities of open source projects in these domains, consider joining the LF AI & Data Foundation. For details

Install
-------

1. Install `CMake <https://cmake.org/install/>`__

.. raw:: html

    <p/>

2. If you've installed TensorFlow from `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/tensorflow>`__, make sure that the ``g++-4.8.5`` or ``g++-4.9`` or above is installed.

   If you've installed PyTorch from `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/torch>`__, make sure that the ``g++-4.9`` or above is installed.

   If you've installed either package from `Conda <https://conda.io>`_, make sure that the ``gxx_linux-64`` Conda package is installed.

.. raw:: html

    <p/>
3. Install OpenMPI and UCX with OpenMPI following the instructions at https://github.com/openucx/ucx/wiki/OpenMPI-and-OpenSHMEM-installation-with-UCX.

4. Install SHMEM-based **Horovod** from source.

   Download repository from GitHub.

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ git clone --recursive https://github.com/collinabidi/horovod
      
Build
-------

1. Enable **PyTorch** and/or **TensorFlow**.
   Modify the ``build_mpi.sh`` and ``build_shmem.sh`` scripts to include the proper flags. If you want to build with PyTorch, make sure that ``HOROVOD_WITH_PYTORCH=1`` is in each of the lines of ``build_mpi.sh`` and ``build_shmem.sh``. If you want to build with TensorFlow, make sure that ``HOROVOD_WITH_TENSORFLOW=1`` is in each of the lines in ``build_mpi.sh`` and ``build_shmem.sh``. If you want to build **without** one, add the ``HOROVOD_WITHOUT_TENSORFLOW=1`` or ``HOROVOD_WITHOUT_PYTORCH=1`` flags.
      $ HOROVOD_GPU_OPERATIONS=NCCL pip install horovod

For more details on installing Horovod with GPU support, read `Horovod on GPU <docs/gpus.rst>`_.

For the full list of Horovod installation options, read the `Installation Guide <docs/install.rst>`_.

If you want to use MPI, read `Horovod with MPI <docs/mpi.rst>`_.

If you want to use Conda, read `Building a Conda environment with GPU support for Horovod <docs/conda.rst>`_.

2. Build **Horovod** with **MPI** or **SHMEM**.

   To build Horovod with MPI enabled, run the ``build_mpi.sh`` script.

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ ./build_mpi.sh

   To build Horovod with SHMEM enabled, run the ``build_shmem.sh`` script.

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ ./build_shmem.sh
      
Usage
-------
1. Run **Horovod** with SLURM.

   If you use SLURM to submit jobs, simply modify the included SLURM script to fit you cluster's configuration. Make sure to correctly load your environment before executing anything. 

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ sbatch hvd_test_2.slurm
      
2. Run **Horovod** without SLURM.

   If you have admin access to your cluster, you can copy the SLURM script into a shell script, remove the variables at the top, and execute normally using the ``horovodrun`` or ``oshrun`` (SHMEM-specific) commands. 
   
   The following is an example of running the included ``pytorch_mnist.py`` script included in the ``example`` folder on 2 nodes (denoted by the ``-np 2`` argument). SHMEM-enabled version of Horovod has several necessary command-line arguments that may vary from system-to-system.

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ oshrun -np 2 -x --mca mpi_cuda_support 0 \
	--mca pml ucx --mca osc ucx \
	--mca atomic ucx --mca orte_base_help_aggregate 0 \
	--mca btl ^vader,tcp,openib,uct python3 pytorch_basic.py --epochs 1 --no-cuda
       $ horovodrun -np 16 -H server1:4,server2:4,server3:4,server4:4 python train.py

3. To run using Open MPI without the ``horovodrun`` wrapper, see `Running Horovod with Open MPI <docs/mpirun.rst>`_.

4. To run in Docker, see `Horovod in Docker <docs/docker.rst>`_.

5. To run in Kubernetes, see `Kubeflow <https://github.com/kubeflow/examples/tree/master/demos/yelp_demo/ks_app/vendor/kubeflow/mpi-job>`_, `MPI Operator <https://github.com/kubeflow/mpi-operator/>`_, `Helm Chart <https://github.com/kubernetes/charts/tree/master/stable/horovod/>`_, `FfDL <https://github.com/IBM/FfDL/tree/master/etc/examples/horovod/>`_, and `Polyaxon <https://docs.polyaxon.com/integrations/horovod/>`_.

6. To run on Spark, see `Horovod on Spark <docs/spark.rst>`_.

7. To run on Ray, see `Horovod on Ray <docs/ray.rst>`_.

8. To run in Singularity, see `Singularity <https://github.com/sylabs/examples/tree/master/machinelearning/horovod>`_.
